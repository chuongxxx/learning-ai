# Random Forest

## Overview

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method primarily used for classification and regression tasks. It operates by building multiple decision trees during training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes for classification or the mean prediction for regression. This method is particularly powerful due to its ability to reduce overfitting and improve generalization by combining the outputs of multiple trees.

This repository contains two types of Random Forest models implemented in JavaScript:
- **RandomForestRegressor**: A Random Forest model for regression tasks.
- **RandomForestClassifier**: A Random Forest model for classification tasks.

## How Random Forest Works

Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their results to improve robustness. Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data and a random subset of features. After training, the model combines the predictions of all the trees to provide a more accurate and stable prediction.

### Steps in Random Forest:
1. **Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging)**: Random Forest uses a technique called bagging, where random subsets of the training data are sampled with replacement. Each tree is trained on a different bootstrap sample.
2. **Random Feature Selection**: For each tree, a random subset of features is selected to find the best splits. This further diversifies the trees and reduces correlation between them.
3. **Combining Predictions**:
   - **Classification**: The final class is determined by majority vote across all the trees in the forest.
   - **Regression**: The final prediction is the average of the predictions from all the trees.

## Why Random Forest?

- **Reduces Overfitting**: Individual decision trees can easily overfit, especially if they are deep. By averaging the predictions of multiple trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting and generalizes better to unseen data.
- **Robust to Noise and Outliers**: Because Random Forests rely on multiple trees, they are less sensitive to noise and outliers in the data.
- **Versatile**: Can be used for both classification and regression problems, and performs well on both tasks.
- **Handles Missing Data**: It can maintain accuracy even when a significant portion of the data is missing.

## Advantages of Random Forest
1. **Accuracy**: Random Forest tends to be more accurate than individual decision trees due to the combination of predictions from multiple trees.
2. **Robustness**: Random Forest is robust to overfitting and noise due to averaging across many trees.
3. **Versatility**: Can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
4. **Parallelization**: The individual trees in a Random Forest are independent of each other, making the training process easily parallelizable.

## Limitations of Random Forest
- **Computational Complexity**: Training multiple decision trees can be computationally expensive and may require more memory and processing power.
- **Interpretability**: While decision trees are easy to interpret, a forest of trees is much harder to interpret, and explaining the decisions of Random Forest can be difficult.
